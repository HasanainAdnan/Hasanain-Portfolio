# Hasanain Adnan — Portfolio (UI & Game Dev)

Dark-mode portfolio with animated background, auto-loading gallery (`/img/work/work-#.ext`), and custom lightbox.

## Tech
- HTML/CSS/JS (no framework), Inter font
- Responsive layout, a11y passes
- GitHub Pages deployment

## How gallery works
Place images in `img/work/` named `work-1.webp/png/jpg`, `work-2…` (up to 100). The script auto-detects extensions.

## Validation proof
See `/docs/validation/` screenshots.
